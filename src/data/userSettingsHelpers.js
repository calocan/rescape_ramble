/***
 * Given the state and userSettings which map the shape of state,
 * and a lens that winnows in on a certain property that is a functor (i.e. list or keyed objects)
 * Merge matching values of the state and userSettings for each value of the functor
 * and apply the given predicate on the result.
 *
 * The predicate checks properties appended to the userSettings version of the data, such as
 * checking for keys like 'isSelected' or 'willDelete' or 'willAdd'
 * @param {Function} lens Ramda lens to winnow in on the property to be filtered
 * @param {Function} predicate Predicate that expects each merged value of the functor of the lens
 * for the state and userSettings. It's possible for a value to only exist in the state and not
 * in the userSettings (and possibly visa-versa if the user is creating something new). These will
 * be included in the merge and run through the predicate
 * @param {Object} state The Redux state. Important: The target of the lens
 * @param {Object} userSettings The user settings that match the shape of the state
 * @returns {*} The filtered merged value pointed to by the lens
 *
 * Example:
 * lens R.lensPath(['foos', 'bars'])
 * predicate value => value.isSelected
 * state: {foos: {bars: [{id: 'bar1', name: 'Bar 1'}, {id: 'bar2', name: 'Bar 2'}]}}
 * userSettings: {foos: {bars: {bar1: {id: 'bar1', isSelected: true}, bar2: {id: 'bar2'}}}}
 * returns: {bar1: {id: 'bar1', name: 'Bar 1' isSelected: true}}
